Different Utilities like keybinds for adventure maps

This is a mod that helps adventure maps to make use of keybindings in a way, in which no mod needs to be installed on the server, but rather it is programmed via data packs.

Keybinds:
3 different Keybinds, which can activate a function in an adventure map

Options(In-Game):
You can change if the different keybinds should be active, whether automatic disabling should be on and you can test if an integration is present.

Options(Extern):
In addition to all of the in-game options, you can also change whether a button that leads to the in-game config should be present in the options screen. (You can still access the in-game config via the mod screen if modmenu is installed)

Automatic Disabling:
Tests for an integration when pressing a keybind for the first time on a world/server.
If no integration is present, further keybinds will be disabled.
You can overrule this by disabling the option "Automatic Disabling".
